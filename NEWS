		CHANGES IN SSPA VERSION 1.99.0
		
NEW FEATURES

    o Added new estimation method for the density of effect sizes and proportion of non differentially expressed genes
    o power and sample size analysis can now also be performed for experimental designs that lead to F and \chi^2 statistics e.g. RNAseq data    

BUG FIXES

    o suppressWarings from dt or pt when ncp is large

		CHANGES IN SSPA VERSION 1.5.1
		
NEW FEATURES

    o Accessor functions for both PilotData and SampleSize class
    o Added Nutrigenomics data for use in examples
    o Updated the citation
    o Updated the vignette
    o Plots produced by the packages are now using the lattice packages	

BUG FIXES

    o replaced call .C("massdist", ... package="stats") to .C("massdist", ... package="sspa")


		CHANGES IN SSPA VERSION 1.5.0

NEW FEATURES

    o Added Student t distribution as distribution for non-differentially expressed genes
    o Added moderated version of the Student t distribution for more reliable results when using SSPA in combination with limma
    o Better upper bound estimates for pi0 taken from Efron et al. (2001) Empirical Bayes Analysis of a Microarray Experiment.
    o Replaced FFT derived characteristic function by analytical expression for the characteristic functions both normal and Student t
   

BUG FIXES

    o In function Power(): corrected the effective sample size if user defined
    o Figure captions in vignette modified
